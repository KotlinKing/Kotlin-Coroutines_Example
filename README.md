# Kotlin-Coroutines_Example
This is an absolute beginner example of Kotlin Coroutines.

Coroutines are another options for threading in android.
So when you need to make use of threading we use coroutines.
So typically when you are making any network request (like retrofit etc.),
you need to work on background thread because you really donâ€™t want to block the main thread.
Also when you are trying to access the internal SQL database on your phone.
So getting result from the background thread and displaying it on main thread.
